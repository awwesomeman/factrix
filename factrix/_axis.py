"""v0.5 analysis-axis enums (§4.1 of refactor_api.md).

Two orthogonal user-facing axes describe an analysis cell:

- ``FactorScope`` — does the factor vary per-asset (``INDIVIDUAL``) or
  carry a single value broadcast to every asset (``COMMON``)?
- ``FactorDensity`` — continuous numeric exposure (``DENSE``) vs.
  ``{0, R}`` event triggers (``SPARSE`` — zero on non-event entries,
  arbitrary real magnitude otherwise; canonical example ``{-1, 0, +1}``)?

``DataStructure`` is the third axis used by registry keys / dispatch but is not
user-set: it is derived from ``N`` at evaluate-time and surfaced as the
third position of ``EvaluationResult.cell`` for downstream pattern-match.

Metric-spec structural enums (``Aggregation``, ``TestMethod``, ``SEMethod``,
``SpecRole``, ``InputShape``, ``OutputShape``) live here alongside the axis
enums so all enum definitions share one import path.
