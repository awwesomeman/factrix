# WHY: shared zero-division floor so std ≈ 0 doesn't inflate t-stat to absurd magnitudes.
EPSILON: float = 1e-9

# WHY: ddof=1 is the sample-std convention (industry standard); fixing it project-wide
# avoids systematic bias across cross-metric comparisons.
# Polars .std() defaults to ddof=1; NumPy requires it explicitly.
DDOF: int = 1

# WHY: 1.4826 = 1/Φ⁻¹(0.75); makes MAD an unbiased estimator of σ under normality.

# Naming grammar: ``MIN_[<DOMAIN>_]<AXIS>[_<TIER>]``. The AXIS token is
# mandatory and names the axis the threshold guards:
#   ``ASSETS``  — cross-sectional asset count (N per date)
#   ``PERIODS`` — time-series length (T, number of dates / draws)
#   ``EVENTS``  — event-date count
# A constant for one axis must never be reused as a threshold on another
# (e.g. an ``_ASSETS`` floor must not gate a series length); introduce a
# separate ``_PERIODS`` constant even when the calibrated value coincides.

# Per-date minimum asset count below which ``compute_ic`` drops the date
# (cross-sectional axis). Spearman ρ needs ≥ this many names per date for
# its asymptotic distribution to hold.
MIN_IC_ASSETS: int = 10

# Minimum IC time-series length (periods axis) for a reliable mean / sign
# test on the per-date IC series: the post-stride sample in ``ic()``, the
# series-length floor in ``hit_rate``, and the raw-period base in the
# non-overlapping inference floor all key off this "≥10 independent draws"
# rule. Distinct axis from ``MIN_IC_ASSETS`` despite the shared value — do
# not collapse.

# Two-tier guard for ``directional_hit_rate`` on its ``pairs`` axis — the
# pooled non-overlapping (date, asset) directional trials the
# Pesaran-Timmermann (1992) test treats as independent draws, NOT periods.
# ``n < MIN_DIRECTIONAL_PAIRS_HARD`` short-circuits to NaN (below ~10 pooled
# trials the PT variance estimate var_s = var(P̂) - var(P*) is numerically
# fragile). ``HARD ≤ n < MIN_DIRECTIONAL_PAIRS_WARN`` returns the hit rate
# with ``WarningCode.FEW_DIRECTIONAL_PAIRS`` — the normal approximation to
# S_n is honest only near ~30 pooled trials (the same asymptotic-honesty
# convention as ``MIN_EVENTS_WARN`` / ``MIN_ASSETS_WARN``). Pairs axis, own
# literals — must not alias ``MIN_IC_PERIODS`` (periods axis).

# t-statistic). ``MIN_EVENTS_HARD ≤ n < MIN_EVENTS_WARN`` returns the
# stat AND emits ``WarningCode.FEW_EVENTS`` so the caller
# knows power is thin (Brown-Warner 1985 convention is ~30 events for
# the asymptotic t to be honest). Descriptive event-quality / horizon /
# clustering metrics use only the HARD floor — they have no formal
